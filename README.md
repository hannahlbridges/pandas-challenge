Bootcamp Homework 3 Pandas Challenge - PyCitySchools Write Up

The analysis of the data shows several trends. The biggest predictor of high math and reading scores (as well as a high percentage of students passing) appears to be school size. Schools with fewer than 1000 students and schools with 1000-2000 students have very similar scores that are significantly higher than schools with 2000-5000 students. This is a particularly interesting finding because the data also shows that the large schools spend more money per student than the smaller schools. Put together this indicates that small schools produce better student score outcomes with less money spent.

Another interesting trend the data shows is the positive relationship between test scores and Charter Schools. A visual inspection of the School Summary DataFrame indicates that Charter Schools account for smallest 8 schools. Without further analysis it is not possible to say whether the higher scores associated with Charter Schools are due to their smaller size or if there is some other difference between Charter Schools and District Schools that both accounts for the positive relationship between Charter Schools and test scores and likely small school size and test scores.

Further analysis focused on that question would provide very interesting information, especially in light of the lesser per student spending seen in Charter Schools.
